# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# katie = User.create(name: "katie", budget: 200)
# katie.friends.create(name: "Joji", gender: "M", birthday: "1989-Aug-18")
# katie.friends.create(name: "Julia", gender: "F", birthday: "1990-Jul-2")
